 <h2>Some Poetry</h2>
    <p>
        <h4>1. JABBERWOCKY</h4>
        Poet: Lewis Carrol
        <hr><pre>
            Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

            Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:

            All mimsy were the borogoves,

            And the mome raths outgrabe.

 

            ‘Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

            The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!

            Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun

            The frumious Bandersnatch!’
        </pre><hr>

        <h4>2. THE RAVEN</h4>
        Poet: Edgar Allan Poe
        <hr><Pre>
            “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—

            “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!

            Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!

            Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!

            Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”

            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
